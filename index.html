<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The final project is an Autonomous safe path detection for fighter jet simulation using a Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller. It will detect the safest path for the fighter jet. You can control the fighter jet using a joystick. It will show "Game Over" on the screen if you don't follow the path and hit a missile.</p> 
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Fighter jets are military aircraft. They are mainly designed for air-to-air combat, and to establish air superiority. So that one can do strategic bombing on enemy targets. Its firepower and high-speed maneuverability are its key features. Which makes it really hard to control and watch the safest path during a battle. The success of the combat totally depends on the skills of the pilot flying the fighter jet. We hope to improve the safety of the pilot and enhance the chances of winning the combat with TopGun, Which will detect the safest path so the pilot can follow it. We have formed the stimulation in a form of a game to show what the actual scenario would look like. This would increase the pilot's speed as he doesn't have to calibrate the path.</p> 

<h2> Vision </h2>
<p> Our vision for the project is to create a simulation environment with user having the control of a fighter jet and the task to dodge the approaching missiles. </p>
