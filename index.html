 <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The final project is an Autonomous safe path detection for fighter jet simulation using a Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller. It will detect the safest path for the fighter jet. You can control the fighter jet using a joystick. It will show "Game Over" on the screen if you don't follow the path and hit a missile.</p> 
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Fighter jets are military aircraft. They are mainly designed for air-to-air combat, and to establish air superiority. So that one can do strategic bombing on enemy targets. Its firepower and high-speed maneuverability are its key features. Which makes it really hard to control and watch the safest path during a battle. The success of the combat totally depends on the skills of the pilot flying the fighter jet. We hope to improve the safety of the pilot and enhance the chances of winning the combat with TopGun, Which will detect the safest path so the pilot can follow it. We have formed the stimulation in a form of a game to show what the actual scenario would look like. This would increase the pilot's speed as he doesn't have to calibrate the path.</p> 


  
  <h2> Vision </h2>
  <p> Our vision for the project is to create a simulation environment with user having the control of a fighter jet and the task to dodge the approaching missiles. </p>

  <h2> Motivation </h2>
  <p> The game in the project resembles a real-world scenario of a fighter-jet. Protecting the in-air fighter jet from approaching missiles is a task of utmost importance, especially in the wartime. Through this project we plan to simulate a similar but simpler environment where user will have to surf across the screen dodging the approaching missiles. </p>

  <h2> Project Details </h2>
  <p> 1. The game can be visualized as a grid of pixels. The jet and missiles are genereated from a set of pixels. </p>
  <p> 2. When the game begins, the jet appears whose initial position is the center of the left end. At the same time, seven missles are fired from the right end of the screen moving towards the left end. </p>
  <p> 3. The missiles only move forward along their horizontal axis and their vertical coords remains the same. Whereas, the jet the free to move in any direction with use of joystick placing the entire control in the hands of the user. </p>
  <p> 4. One loop accounts for one forward movement of the missile (the missile will jump some pixels on the grid depending upon it's speed). The loops will continue until the missile's face reaches the left end. After that the missile will be regenerated again at the right end and this algorithm works independently for each missile. </p>
  <p> 5. Every missile moves at a random speed which depends upon the random number generated at the start of each loop. 
  <p> 6. Dimensions of missile and jet are 30x17 pixels. The wings size differ for both, 10 pixels for jet and 5 pixels for missile. With one adc movement the jet moves 15 pixels according to the command. The adc instructions are given after every loop. </p>
  <p> 7. At the end of every loop the algorithm checks if the pixels of jet overlaps with the pixels of missiles i.e if there is a crash. If this happens then the jet is crashed and "Game Over" message is dispayed. If the user surfs successfully through the screen then they win the game. A computationally efficient logic is implemented for crash check, avoiding any lags, which will be expained in a latter section. </p>
  <p> 8. An audio is added for enhancing the user experience. </p>
