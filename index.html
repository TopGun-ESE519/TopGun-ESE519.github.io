  <h2> Issues and identified solutions </h2>
  <p> 1. VGA cable connections: We faced issues with VGA cable connections made using jumper wires. The code was running properly but the color display on VGA wasn’t accurate. We were not able to fill the pixels with black color. This issue was tackled using VGA socket which kinda fixed the jumper wires and display was much clearer than previous. The problem was probably due to loose connections of jumper wires.</p>
  <p> 2. Issue with Pico4ml: Pico4ml has an inbuilt camera which can be accessed for point-tracking tasks. We successfully ran the code and captured images using the board. But when we tried running our code on Pico4ml board, it didn’t work. The motion of the missiles wasn’t continuous and it ran only for 7 loops before abruptly stopping. Decreasing the computation work by reducing the number of missiles resulted in code running for 11 loops. With this results we can conclude that the board couldn’t handle the load. Another reason could be with PIO instructions. As the VGA was running on PIO, probably some changes are required in the file when the Pico4ml is used. Due to time restrictions we were not able to explore this possibility. </p>
  <p> 3. Crash Detection issue: Pixel by pixel mapping of jet and missiles one by one between every two ADC commands would be extremely inefficient process. The board may not be able to sustain such a computational load and even if it does there will a huge lag in the operations. So we have developed simpler but sufficiently accurate algorithm for crash detection. Now note that the position of missiles on the vertical line are always fixed. So, the entire system is designed in a way that for any given jet position there will be two missiles in the range of jet with which the probability of crashing is there. We just check if the cords of the tip of missiles have crossed the tip of jet. Then, by design, the jet must have crossed through the missile and that means a crash has taken place. So, the algorithm shortlists the missiles in the range and then checks for crash by point mapping.</p>
  
  
   <h2> Components used </h2>
  <p> 1. Raspberry Pi Pico: Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. It has Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz, 264 kB of SRAM,  2 MB of on-board flash memory, 26 × multi-function GPIO pins, 2 × SPI, 2 × I2C, 2 × UART, 3 × 12-bit ADC, 16 × controllable PWM channels, 8 × Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines for custom peripheral support. We have utilized 5 digital pins for VGA display, 2 analog pins for the joystick's X & Y values and a PWM pin for the speaker.</p>
  <p> 2. Joystick module: Similar to the "analog" joysticks on PS2 (PlayStation 2) controllers, this JoyStick Module PS2 Breakout Sensor is used. Two potentiometers, one for each axis, are all that are needed to move in one direction. Pots cost 10,000 each. The select button on this joystick is activated when the joystick is depressed. By moving the "hat," we use this Joystick Module to measure position coordinates on the X and Y axes. Additionally, it has a switch that may be operated by pushing the hat just  like the Xbox controller in style. Two 10k potentiometers on the X and Y axes produce analog data to regulate 2D movement. Two analog values that represent two directions will be output by the module when it is in operating mode. The value that can be read from the analog pin of this module, which operates on a 5V power supply, is approximately 2.5V. As the joystick is moved, the value rises to a maximum of 5V; otherwise, it falls to 0V.</p>
  <p> 3. VGA display: VGA (Video Graphics Array) is an analog interface between a PC and monitor that was widely used prior to DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort. In 1987, the IBM PS/2 line of computers launched the Video Graphics Array (VGA), a video display controller and associated de facto graphics standard that quickly spread throughout the PC industry. The phrase can now be used to describe the 640x480 resolution feature of the VGA hardware, the computer display standard, or the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector.</p>
  <p> 4. General purpose PCB: General purpose PCBs are used frequently to arbitrarily embed circuits for running electronics, as their name suggests. Copper is applied to its layer, which enables good soldering without any short circuits. There are no connections built on general purpose boards, so connections must be made. We need to solder in order to create tracks manually to connect the components. This gives us more freedom as compared to breadboards.<p>
  <p> 5. Jumper wires: An electrical wire, or group of them in a cable, with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them - simply "tinned") is known as a jump wire (also known as a jumper, jumper wire, or DuPont wire), and it is typically used to connect the parts of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other machinery or components, without soldering. A breadboard, a circuit board's header connector, or a piece of test equipment can all be used to create slots for the "end connectors" that hold individual jump wires.<p>
  <p> 6. Adafruit STEMMA Speaker: We can quickly and safely connect sensors and devices with Adafruit STEMMA boards, such as this STEMMA Speaker - Plug and Play Audio Amplifier. It includes a small 1 Watt 8 ohm speaker and a class D audio amplifier. It is simple to set up because all we require is ground, 3 to 5V of power, and an audio signal. The audio signal can go up to the power pin voltage without needing to be AC linked (3 or 5V peak-to-peak). The volume may be changed with a little screwdriver, and the sound quality is enough for music, tones, and voice.<p>
